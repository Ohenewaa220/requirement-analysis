# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository documents the process of **Requirement Analysis** in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).  
It focuses on a case study of a **Booking Management System**, highlighting how structured requirements provide a strong foundation for project success.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  
It ensures that the system being developed aligns with user needs, business goals, and technical feasibility.  

Key points:
- It bridges the gap between stakeholders and developers.  
- It reduces project risks by clarifying expectations early.  
- It serves as the foundation for design, development, and testing.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. **Clarity of Goals** – Ensures all stakeholders share a common understanding of system objectives.  
2. **Risk Reduction** – Identifies challenges and constraints early, minimizing costly rework later.  
3. **Improved Quality** – Leads to software that better satisfies user needs and business goals.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- **Requirement Gathering** – Collecting needs from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and research.  
- **Requirement Elicitation** – Engaging stakeholders to draw out hidden or unclear requirements.  
- **Requirement Documentation** – Recording requirements in a structured, accessible format.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling** – Breaking down and visualizing requirements to ensure feasibility.  
- **Requirement Validation** – Checking that requirements are complete, consistent, and aligned with business needs.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These describe **what the system should do**.  
Examples for the Booking Management System:  
- Users can create and manage bookings.  
- The system sends confirmation emails upon booking.  
- Admins can add, edit, or remove listings.  

### Non-functional Requirements
These describe **how the system performs**.  
Examples:  
- The system should load booking results in under 2 seconds.  
- It must support at least 1,000 concurrent users.  
- The interface should be mobile-responsive.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams show the **interactions between system actors and use cases**, providing a visual overview of functionality.  

Benefits:  
- Simple and intuitive visualization of system scope.  
- Helps identify key user interactions.  
- Clarifies system boundaries and responsibilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria define the **conditions a feature must meet** to be considered complete and accepted by stakeholders.  

Importance:  
- Ensures features meet user and business needs.  
- Provides measurable, testable benchmarks.  
- Prevents misunderstandings between developers and clients.  

**Example – Checkout Feature:**  
- User can select a booking and proceed to checkout.  
- System displays booking summary, total cost, and payment options.  
- Payment must be processed securely.  
- Confirmation email must be sent to the user after successful payment.
